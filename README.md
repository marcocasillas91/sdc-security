# Datalab Social Data Challenge Project
## Problem to analize: Insecurity in Mexico
This repo contains information about the project, which will consist on using public and private data 
to analize the crime problem in Mexico. 

We will be choosing a more specific approach with time in terms of location and issue, and will
base our work in the Agent-Based Modeling technique to understand the interaction of Agents and 
Environment that are involved on this topic.

We expect to use Machine Learning as well in rder to predict some criminal behaviour or to find patters in data.
