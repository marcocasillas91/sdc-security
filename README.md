# Datalab Social Data Challenge Project
## Problem to analize: Insecurity in Mexico
This repo contains information about the project, which will consist on using public and private data 
to analize the crime problem in Mexico. 

We will be choosing a more specific approach with time in terms of location and issue, and will
base our work in the Agent-Based Modeling technique to understand the interaction of Agents and 
Environment that are involved on this topic.

We also expect to use Machine Learning in order to predict some criminal behaviour or to find patterns in data.

##Experiments##

The information obtained through the aforementioned sources was consolidated to create two
types of datasets: the first used the location of each robbery against a pedestrian within the alcaldia
Cuauht√©moc, while the second is based on map locations with a fixed distance between them: a
grid.
In the first scenario, we collected crime information, as well as the location of
main roads, patrol areas, metro stations and system video surveillance cameras
C5 using the geolocation software QGIS. The following image shows a combination of
layers with this information.
